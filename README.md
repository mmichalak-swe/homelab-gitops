# homelab-gitops
Declarative Docker Compose deployments powered by GitOps and Portainer.

This repository provides a GitOps-driven workflow for managing containerized applications using Docker Compose and Portainer. By storing Compose configurations in version control, deployments become declarative, repeatable, and auditable, ensuring consistency across environments.
With this setup, Portainer continuously monitors the repository for changes and automatically applies updates, enabling:
- 🚀 Seamless container deployments
- 🔄 Automated updates via GitOps
- 🛠️ Centralized management through Portainer
- 📜 Version-controlled infrastructure-as-code

Ideal for my homelab, this is a lightweight GitOps approach without the overhead of Kubernetes. This repository makes container lifecycle management simple, transparent, and reliable.
